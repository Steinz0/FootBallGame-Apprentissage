# FootballGame-ML

## Start

# With Docker

To start the environnement, you just need to start the Docker compose.

First, you need to build him:
```
sudo docker-compose build
```
And after that you can start it:
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

# Without Docker

Not the best idea, but can by following these commands and by changing the AMQP URL by localhost:5672

To start the web server, you need to use the following commmand while in the **/** directory (to install nodejs : https://nodejs.org/en/download/) : 
```
node app/app.js
```

A RabbitMQ server is also needed for Celery. You can start and enable a server with the following commands (to install nodejs : https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) :
```
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
```

To check if rabbitmq is running smoothly, you should get "(status : running)" when running the following command :
```
sudo systemctl status rabbitmq-server
```

Note - With **erlang**, you can go on "localhost:15672" to open the RabbitMQ Management panel.

You can now run a Celery server using the command shown below :
```
celery -A <File-Contain-Celery-App> worker -l info
```

## Datasets structures

2 Datasets:

This MongoDB dataset registers all of the party IDs for every user registered.

For each element, we save :
